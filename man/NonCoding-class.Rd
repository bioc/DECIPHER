\title{
NonCoding Objects and Methods
}
\description{
Non-coding RNAs can be represented by their conserved sequence motifs, secondary structure, and k-mer frequencies.  Class \code{NonCoding} provides objects and functions for representing non-coding RNAs.
}
\usage{
\method{print}{NonCoding}(x, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
An object of class \code{NonCoding}.
}
  \item{\dots}{
Other optional parameters.
}
}
\details{
Objects of class \code{NonCoding} are stored as lists containing a compact representation of a family of non-coding RNAs.  The first list component is a matrix of sequence motifs that identify the non-coding RNAs, the second is a matrix of hairpin loops that are conserved across the family, and the third is a list of k-mer frequencies derived from representative sequences.  Patterns are defined by their distance to either end of the non-coding RNA, which helps to identify the boundaries of the non-coding RNA in a genome.
